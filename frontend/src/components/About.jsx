        <p className='p-2'>We believe that grants, charity, technology, and 
          markets alone cannot sustainably address the problems 
          the world faces today. Therefore, we promote an Inclusive 
          Business Eco-system, where key stakeholders including communities,
           companies, government, investors, technical experts, and entrepreneurs
            work together to address these issues sustainably and permanently.
        </p>
        <p className='p-2'>Our agroforestry model approach is an innovative, system changing 
          process through which small farmers not only achieve enhanced food, 
          nutrition, and income security, but also meet the demands of raw material 
          for leading industries, such as pulp and paper, herbal products, and other 
          agro-based products. The model also reduce global warming through carbon sequestration, 
          and conserve natural resources by gradually enhancing their regenerative capacity.
        </p>
        <p className='p-2'>
        The model is inclusive because it not only benefits people with the land 
        but also the landless and the unemployed rural youth. We generate approximately
         100 person-days of wage employment per acre during harvesting & transportation
          of harvested produce. This provides the landless with employment at home and 
          protects women and adolescent girls from harassment and exploitation outside.
        </p>
        <p className='p-2'>
        SAI identifies and trains rural unemployed youth to become ‘Community Resource Person’ (CRP). 
        Upon successful training, they are inducted as full-time employees with SAI to provide 
        one-to-one support to the 
        small farmers for which they earn an attractive salary and social recognition.

          <div className='text-xl'>
          <p className='p-2'>We negotiate and sign a buy-back agreement with the paper mills. The key clause of the agreement is that the paper mills would procure raw materials through SAI at current or future price, whichever is higher at the time of harvesting.
          </p>
          <p className='p-2'>Following this,  we mobilize and organize small and marginal farmers by conducting door-to-door awareness campaigns, and model farm visits.  We build their capacity, organize agriculture equipment, provide doorstep delivery of inputs, and provide technical support throughout the production cycle. At the time of maturity, we organize harvesting, processing and transport. We take care of the end-to-end, ensuring complete transparency, and  thereby eliminating the middlemen.
          </p>
          <p className='p-2'>
          SAI’s unique feature is its Community Resource Person (CRP) concept. The CRP is a rural youth, belonging to the local area and selected by farmers themselves. These youth are trained by SAI to build their capacity to provide one to one support to the collaborative farmers for which they are paid monthly honorarium as well as performance incentives.

          <p className='p-2'>We are a B2B (Business to Business) and B2C (Business to Customers) company. We enter into partnerships with the farmers who fit our selection criteria. A nominal fee is also collected from the farmers.. In lieu, we provide services including farmers’ mobilisation, training and technical support, access to finance, quality inputs and farm machinery, supply chain management with direct marketing to the institutional customers. We strive for quality service as our charges are based on the volume and quality of the final product. After deduction of expenses, we share the profits equally with our farmers.</p>
          <p className='p-2'>Our second source of revenue is from the industry. We get premiums for the supply of raw material from their core zone, which not only reduces their overall cost of production but also lowers the carbon footprint from transportation due to shorter transport distances.</p>
          <p className='p-2'>
          Our third source of revenue is through value addition and marketing of the inter-crops.
